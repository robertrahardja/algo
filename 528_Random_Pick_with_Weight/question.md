# 528. Random Pick with Weight

Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i] describes the
        weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which
        randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

    Note:

    
        1 <= w.length <= 10000
        1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
        pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.
    

    Example 1:

    Input:
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]
