# 854. K-Similar Strings

Strings A and B are K-similar (for some
        non-negative integer K) if we can swap the positions of two letters in
        A exactly K times so that the resulting string equals
        B.

    Given two anagrams A and B, return the smallest K for
        which A and B are K-similar.

    Example 1:

    Input: A = "ab", B = "ba"
Output: 1
