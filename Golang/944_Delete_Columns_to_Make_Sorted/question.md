# 944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted

We are given an array A of N lowercase letter strings, all of
        the same length.

    Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the
        characters in those indices.

    For example, if we have an array A = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"]
        and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is ["bef",
            "vyz"], and the remaining columns of A
        are ["b","v"], ["e","y"],
        and ["f","z"].  (Formally, the c-th
        column is [A[0][c], A[1][c], ..., A[A.length-1][c]].)

    Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, each
        remaining column in A is in non-decreasing sorted order.

    Return the minimum possible value of D.length.
