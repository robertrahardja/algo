# 925. Long Pressed Name

Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when
        typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the
        character will be typed 1 or more times.

    You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return
        True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters
        (possibly none) being long pressed.

     

    Example 1:

    Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
