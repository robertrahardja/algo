666_Path_Sum_IV
# 666. Path Sum IV

If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by a
        list of three-digits integers.

    For each integer in this list:

    
        The hundreds digit represents the depth D of this node, 1 <= D
            <= 4.
        The tens digit represents the position P of this node in the level it
            belongs to, 1 <= P <= 8. The position is the same as that in a full
            binary tree.
        
        The units digit represents the value V of this node, 0 <= V <=
            9.
    

     

    Given a list of ascending three-digits integers representing a binary tree with
        the depth smaller than 5, you need to return the sum of all paths from the root towards the
        leaves.

    Example 1:

    Input: [113, 215, 221]
Output: 12
Explanation:
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
   / \
  5   1

The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.

     

    Example 2:

    Input: [113, 221]
Output: 4
Explanation:
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
     \
      1

The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.
