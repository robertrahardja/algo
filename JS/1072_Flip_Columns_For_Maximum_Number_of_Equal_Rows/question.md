# 1072. Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal Rows

Given a matrix consisting of 0s and 1s, we may choose any number of columns in
        the matrix and flip every cell in that column.  Flipping a cell
        changes the value of that cell from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

    Return the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips.
