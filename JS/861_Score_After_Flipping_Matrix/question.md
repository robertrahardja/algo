# 861. Score After Flipping Matrix

We have a two dimensional matrix A where each value is 0 or
        1.

    A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column:
        changing all 0s to 1s, and all 1s to 0s.
    

    After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number,
        and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

    Return the highest possible score.
