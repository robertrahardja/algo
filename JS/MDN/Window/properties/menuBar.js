//When comparing the locationbar and menubar objects in browser JavaScript, they share similar purposes but represent different UI elements:
// Similarities
//
// Purpose: Both are legacy DOM objects that indicate visibility of browser UI elements
// API Structure: Both have a .visible boolean property to check if their respective UI element is visible
// Read-only: In modern browsers, both properties are generally read-only
// Window objects: Both are accessed as properties of the window object
//
// Differences
//
// UI Element Represented:
//
// locationbar represents the address/URL bar at the top of the browser
// menubar represents the menu bar (with File, Edit, View, etc.) typically at the very top of the browser window
//
//
// Default Visibility:
//
// locationbar is almost always visible in modern browsers for security reasons
// menubar is often hidden by default in modern browsers, especially in more minimal UI designs
//
//
// Practical Usage:
//
// locationbar.visible might be checked when creating a web application that wants to detect if it's running in "app mode"
// menubar.visible might be checked when a web application needs to know if it has the full browser chrome or a more minimal view
// Check both UI elements
console.log("Location bar visible:", window.locationbar.visible);
console.log("Menu bar visible:", window.menubar.visible);

// Example of checking if running in a minimal UI
if (!window.menubar.visible && window.locationbar.visible) {
  console.log("Possibly running in a minimal browser UI with address bar");
}
