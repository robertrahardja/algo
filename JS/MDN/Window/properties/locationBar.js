// The locationbar object in browsers is a legacy DOM feature that primarily serves a single purpose: to check whether the browser's location bar (address bar) is visible to the user.
// Its main functionality is exposed through the locationbar.visible property, which is a boolean value indicating if the address bar is currently displayed in the browser window. For example:
if (window.locationbar.visible) {
  console.log("The location bar is visible");
} else {
  console.log("The location bar is hidden");
}
