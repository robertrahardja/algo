# 141. Linked List Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

    To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which
        represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If
        pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
