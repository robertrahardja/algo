# 1121. Divide Array Into Increasing Sequences

Given a non-decreasing array of positive integers nums and
        an integer K, find out if this array can be divided into one or more disjoint
            increasing subsequences of length at least K.

     

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,4,4], K = 3
Output: true
Explanation: 
The array can be divided into the two subsequences [1,2,3,4] and [2,3,4] with lengths at least 3 each.

    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [5,6,6,7,8], K = 3
Output: false
Explanation: 
There is no way to divide the array using the conditions required.

     

    Note:

    
        1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
        1 <= K <= nums.length
        1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
