# 947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

On a 2D plane, we place stones at some integer coordinate points.  Each coordinate point
        may have at most one stone.

    Now, a move consists of removing a stone that shares a column or row with
        another stone on the grid.

    What is the largest possible number of moves we can make?
