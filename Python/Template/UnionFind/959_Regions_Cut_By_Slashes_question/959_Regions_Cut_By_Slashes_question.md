# 959. Regions Cut By Slashes

In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a
        /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square
        into contiguous regions.

    (Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as
        "\\".)

    Return the number of regions.
