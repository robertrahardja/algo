# 956. Tallest Billboard

You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height.  The billboard
        will have two steel supports, one on each side.  Each steel support must be an equal
        height.

    You have a collection of rods which can be welded together.  For example,
        if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of
        length 6.

    Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation.  If you cannot
        support the billboard, return 0.

     

    Example 1:

    Input: [1,2,3,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.
