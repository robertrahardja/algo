# 1027. Longest Arithmetic Sequence

Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest
        arithmetic subsequence in A.

    Recall that a subsequence of A is a list A[i_1], A[i_2], ...,
        A[i_k] with 0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1,
        and that a sequence B is arithmetic if B[i+1] - B[i]
        are all the same value (for 0 <= i < B.length - 1).

     

    Example 1:

    Input: [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
