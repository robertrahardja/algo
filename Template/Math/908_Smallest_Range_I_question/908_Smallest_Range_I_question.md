908_Smallest_Range_I
# 908. Smallest Range I

Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we may choose
        any x with -K <= x <= K, and add x to A[i].
    

    After this process, we have some array B.

    Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and
        the minimum value of B.
