# 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent

You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each
        garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

    paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden
        x to garden y.

    Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

    Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens
        connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

    Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i]
        is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower
        types are denoted 1, 2,
        3, or 4.  It is guaranteed
        an answer exists.
