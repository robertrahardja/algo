# 478. Generate Random Point in a Circle

Given the radius and x-y positions of the center of a circle, write a function randPoint which generates
        a uniform random point in the circle.

    Note:

    
        input and output values are in floating-point.
        
        radius and x-y position of the center of the circle is passed into the class
            constructor.
        
        a point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle.
        randPoint returns a size 2 array containing x-position and
            y-position of the random point, in that order.
